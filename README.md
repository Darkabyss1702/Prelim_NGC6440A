# Prelim_NGC6440A

These notebooks contain some of my initial code while analysing 2 hours worth of L-band MeerKAT data.
77 hours live in Hercules (MPIfR); I have just been working with variations of 2 hours in Ilifu to grasp my first steps.

I experimented to see if fitting Gaussians to reduce dimensionality would prove effective in Hons_Resolution_comp.ipynb
Obtaining the number of modes is the next priority. I attempt this in DBSCAN_Residuals (not a fabulous clustering result).
I make some plots in Waterfall_Plot_10s_2hr.ipynb for visualisation which will be required for the Pulsar 2025 conference in Sardinia.
